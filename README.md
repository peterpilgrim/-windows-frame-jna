# README for EXPERIMENT

Is it is possible to find out the Windows 10 location, positions and dimension in the user interface?

Yes

Is it then possible to reposition windows? 

-?-

Everytime, I disconnect the laptop from the hub, I would like the windows to be remembered.
When I reconnect the laptop to the hub, which has external monitors, it would be great to restore the arrangement of windows for applications. 

Anyway, an experiment, research in Java
